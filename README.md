M’ Corp is developing an application that will allow users to send messages and at the same time track security.
This application will be powered by AI technology.
The security will be composed of an encryption process and it is mandatory to follow this file-conversion >> “chyper-code.xlsx”
It was requested that your team (max: 4 team members) develop the application and a ML model (python-based).
A dataset was provided to support the training process (“file.xls”). The algorithm to be used is a team decision.
The Data storage is mandatory (database or a file approach). Database(s): SQLite (free), MS SQL Server, ...
The data generated by the application (user’s entry) will be used to test real scenarios. The records must ne extracted from the DB (“data-entry.csv”) 
and feed the model to receive an automatic span or no-span detection.
Your Jupyter notebook will be used to verify the records (mail messages) classification.
